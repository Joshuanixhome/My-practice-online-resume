    <h2>My Journey</h2>
<br />
<p>Insert picture of me</p>
<br />
    <p>Im a highly ambitious highschool student who has been beyond curious about how aspects that I use in my everyday
        life function. The functionaity of the internet has been my greatest contemplation as I've grown to use it more and more.
        I began to learn how the internet works when I was 12 years old, taking my first coding classes at 13 introducing me to the world of 
        web development on a extremely simplistic level. My biggest regret up to now was not taking advantage of the time I had when I was younger to learn more skills. 
        Althought Ive just started learning Html, Css+, Java, and Python at 16 I am ambitiously trying to make up for lost time and learn
        as efficiently as possible making sure to build the right foundation I need to be able to create the mesmerizing websites I admire such as Apple. From the skills of Html, Im stacking CSS+, Java Script, Python, Graphic Design, and Swift. 
        I feel comfortable making a promise that in the next 3 to 4 years I'll develop my skills beyond my previous recognition
    </p>
    <h3>With everything I learn I only hope to increase my ability to provide value to business and more, I do this to achieve my own financial freedom by helping others achieve financial freedom through the success of their company</h3>
